      Local jurisdictions are putting forward solutions to the global problem of
      climate change through Climate Action Plans. These documents strive to
      first quantify the greenhouse gas emissions within a city's scope of
      influence and then put forward strategies to reduce future emissions. The
      Bay Area Quality Management District (Air District) has provided formal
      guidance to assist jurisdictions in developing these plans. A key
      component of local jurisdictions' greenhouse gas footprint is passenger
      vehicle travel. There is, however, no obvious approach to allocating the
      responsibility of the GHG from vehicle travel to individual jurisdictions.
      Several entities have put forward suggestions for how to approach this
      allocation, some of which the Air District notes in the guidance
      referenced above. The purpose of this data portal is to quickly and easily
      deliver consistent, jurisdiction-specific estimates of vehicle miles
      traveled. Importantly, this data is consistent with the travel outcomes
      associated with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's long-range
      transportation plan, which meets a state-mandated GHG reduction target.

      The Metropolitan Transportation Commission or MTC, is the transportation
      planning, financing and coordinating agency for the nine-county San
      Francisco Bay Area. As part of their work MTC deploys and maintains a
      large-scale simulation model of daily travel behavior to support its
      regional transportation planning efforts, most notably in the regional
      transit document Plan Bay Area. The model simulates transportation
      activities that the average household currently living in (for simulations
      of historical years), or expected to be living in (for simulations of
      future years), in the nine-county Bay Area. The model is documented in
      great detail on this webpage and the implementation scripts are shared and
      maintained on [GitHub]. The Data Portal summaries are drawn from the same
      model output that informs MTC's regional transportation plan and
      sustainable communities strategy. Therefore, the data is consistent with
      the travel data used in preparing regional plans to address transportation
      and land use, air quality, and greenhouse gases. The simulation involves
      the prediction of numerous travel-related outcomes, including: where the
      household is located; the location of employment of workers in the
      household and where the students go to school; the time during which
      workers work, students go to school; the time and location in which
      individuals engage in other, non-work and non-school, activities; the
      means by which travelers get around (e.g., walk, drive, take the bus);
      and, the routes travelers take to get around (e.g., I-80 to Mission
      Boulevard, the #1 bus). Two important notes are as follows: The model
      attempts to simulate a "typical" weekday, defined as a weekday when school
      is in session, the weather is good, and no major accidents or construction
      activities are taking place on the roadway. The travel model operates an
      abstracted spatial system: rather than moving between two precise
      locations, travelers move between what we call "travel analysis zones". In
      MTC's current travel model, the travel analysis zones are similar in size
      to Census tracts. We assume that a traveler going to a travel analysis
      zone could be going to any precise location within the travel analysis
      zone's boundaries. One of the outputs of the simulation is a detailed
      record of every trip made by every simulated traveler. We define a "trip"
      as a movement between two locations where travelers engage in activities,
      e.g. from home to work, from school to the grocery store. The trip records
      include the trip's means of travel and travel distance as well as the
      traveler's home and work locations. This output can be used to create the
      data presented in the Climate Action Plan Vehicle Miles Traveled Data
      Portal. This is done via the following steps: define the subject
      geography, i.e. the city or county; identify the simulated travelers that
      live in the subject geography; identify the simulated travelers that work
      in the subject geography; compute the VMT for each simulated trip, which
      is simply the distance traveled in a distance divided by the number of
      travelers in the vehicle (if three travelers are in the vehicle, the
      movement is listed three times in the trip file); identify trips that
      begin in the subject geography; identify trips that end in the subject
      geography; and, sum the vehicle miles traveled by the six live/work market
      segments and the three start/end travel segments shown in the Data Portal
      summaries. These data summaries include only non-commercial travel.
      Meaning, it does not include travel made by taxi drivers, plumbers, etc.,
      or for moving goods/freight. Three key caveats are as follows: Our
      simulation model explicitly assumes that every worker living in the
      nine-county Bay Area also works in the nine-county Bay Area. This is, of
      course, not always true, particularly in areas at the boundary of our
      planning region (e.g., Dixon). This caveat should be kept in mind when
      examining the results for jurisdictions near the boundary of our planning
      area. The data is simulated: we are using models to predict where people
      live and how they get around. The models are based on observations
      collected at different points in time and are routinely reviewed by State
      and Federal entities. We believe the data is robust and useful for
      informing Climate Action Plans -- but it is simulated, not observed. The
      land use allocations used by MTC likely differ from those used by the
      county Congestion Management Agencies. Specifically, when doing
      sub-regional planning, MTC -- in the Congestion Management Plan context --
      allows counties to re-allocate land use within their counties to different
      locations. There may, therefore, be minor inconsistencies between regional
      outcomes of the types presented in the Data Portal estimated by MTC and
      county outcomes estimated by Congestion Management Agencies. The
      Congestion Management Agencies may also use different travel modeling
      tools.
