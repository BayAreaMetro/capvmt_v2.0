                  These documents strive to first quantify the greenhouse gas
                  emissions within a city's scope of influence and then put
                  forward strategies to reduce future emissions. The Bay Area
                  Quality Management District <a href="https://www.baaqmd.gov">(Air District)</a> has provided formal
                  guidance to assist jurisdictions in developing these plans. A
                  key component of local jurisdictions' greenhouse gas footprint
                  is passenger vehicle travel. There is, however, no obvious
                  approach to allocating the responsibility of the GHG from
                  vehicle travel to individual jurisdictions. Several entities
                  have put forward suggestions for how to approach this
                  allocation, some of which the Air District notes in the
                  guidance referenced above. The purpose of this data portal is
                  to quickly and easily deliver consistent,
                  jurisdiction-specific estimates of vehicle miles traveled.
                  Importantly, this data is consistent with the travel outcomes
                  associated with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's
                  long-range transportation plan, which meets a state-mandated
                  GHG reduction target.

                <strong>
                  The <a href="https://mtc.ca.gov">Metropolitan Transportation Commission</a> or MTC, is the
                  transportation planning, financing and coordinating agency for
                  the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.
                </strong>
                As part of their work MTC deploys and maintains a large-scale
                simulation model of daily travel behavior to support its
                regional transportation planning efforts, most notably in the
                regional transit document <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org">Plan Bay Area.</a> <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                The model simulates transportation activities that the average
                household currently living in (for simulations of historical
                years), or expected to be living in (for simulations of future
                years), in the nine-county Bay Area. The model is documented in
                great detail on this <a href="https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/modeling-website/wiki/TravelModel">webpage</a> and the implementation scripts are
                shared and maintained on <a href="https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-one">[GitHub]</a>. The Data Portal summaries are
                drawn from the same model output that informs MTC's regional
                transportation plan and sustainable communities strategy.
                Therefore, the data is consistent with the travel data used in
                preparing regional plans to address transportation and land use,
                air quality, and greenhouse gases. The simulation involves the
                prediction of numerous travel-related outcomes, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>where the household is located;</li>
                  <li>
                    the location of employment of workers in the household and
                    where the students go to school;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the time during which workers work, students go to school;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the time and location in which individuals engage in other,
                    non-work and non-school, activities;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the means by which travelers get around (e.g., walk, drive,
                    take the bus);
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    and, the routes travelers take to get around (e.g., I-80 to
                    Mission Boulevard, the #1 bus).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                
              </p>

              <p>
                Two important notes are as follows: <br />
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    The model attempts to simulate a "typical" weekday, defined as a
                    weekday when school is in session, the weather is good, and no
                    major accidents or construction activities are taking place on
                    the roadway. 
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    The travel model operates an abstracted spatial
                    system: rather than moving between two precise locations,
                    travelers move between what we call "travel analysis zones". In
                    MTC's current travel model, the travel analysis zones are
                    similar in size to Census tracts. We assume that a traveler
                    going to a travel analysis zone could be going to any precise
                    location within the travel analysis zone's boundaries.
                  </li> 
                </ol>
                 One of the outputs of the simulation is a detailed record of every trip
                made by every simulated traveler. We define a "trip" as a
                movement between two locations where travelers engage in
                activities, e.g. from home to work, from school to the grocery
                store. The trip records include the trip's means of travel and
                travel distance as well as the traveler's home and work
                locations. This output can be used to create the data presented
                in the Climate Action Plan Vehicle Miles Traveled Data Portal.
                This is done via the following steps: <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>define the subject geography, i.e. the city or county;</li>
                  <li>identify the simulated travelers that live in the subject geography;</li>  
                  <li>identify the simulated travelers that work in the subject geography;</li>  
                  <li>compute the VMT for each simulated trip, which is simply the distance
                    traveled in a distance divided by the number of travelers in the
                    vehicle (if three travelers are in the vehicle, the movement is
                    listed three times in the trip file);</li> 
                  <li>identify trips that begin in the subject geography;</li>  
                  <li>identify trips that end in the subject geography; </li> 
                  <li>and, sum the vehicle miles traveled by the six
                    live/work market segments and the three start/end travel
                    segments shown in the Data Portal summaries.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These data summaries include only non-commercial travel. Meaning, it does
                  not include travel made by taxi drivers, plumbers, etc., or for
                  moving goods/freight.</p>
                
                Three key caveats are as follows:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                  <li>Our simulation model explicitly assumes that every worker living in
                    the nine-county Bay Area also works in the nine-county Bay Area.
                    This is, of course, not always true, particularly in areas at
                    the boundary of our planning region (e.g., Dixon). This caveat
                    should be kept in mind when examining the results for
                    jurisdictions near the boundary of our planning area.</li>  <br>
                   <li>The data is simulated: we are using models to predict where people live
                    and how they get around. The models are based on observations
                    collected at different points in time and are routinely reviewed
                    by State and Federal entities. We believe the data is robust and
                    useful for informing Climate Action Plans -- but it is
                    simulated, not observed. </li> <br>
                   <li>The land use allocations used by MTC
                    likely differ from those used by the county Congestion
                    Management Agencies. Specifically, when doing sub-regional
                    planning, MTC -- in the Congestion Management Plan context --
                    allows counties to re-allocate land use within their counties to
                    different locations. There may, therefore, be minor
                    inconsistencies between regional outcomes of the types presented
                    in the Data Portal estimated by MTC and county outcomes
                    estimated by Congestion Management Agencies. The Congestion
                    Management Agencies may also use different travel modeling
                    tools.</li>

                    <p>
                      A climate action plan (CAP) is a community-wide GHG
                      reduction policy document. CAPs may also address
                      adaptation measures for adjusting to a changing climate.
                      CAPs include a GHG target, an inventory of GHG sources in
                      the community and a comprehensive strategy to meet the
                      target.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      VMT is important for calculating greenhouse gases (GHG)
                      associated with the transportation section of a CAP. VMT
                      calculations provided by a local transit planning
                      organization such as the Bay Area’s Metropolitan
                      Transportation Commission (MTC) can be useful to align
                      CAPs with regional transit plans such as Plan Bay Area.

                      Place geography used by this tool is provided and
                      maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau. This geography
                      includes both Incorporated Places and Census Designated
                      Places (CDPs). Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZs) are
                      the basic geographic unit used for modeling travel
                      behavior within a Metropolitan Planning Organization’s
                      (MPO) boundaries. TAZ boundaries are largely defined by
                      population size. Because of this, a Place boundary is
                      typically larger than a TAZ boundary in very densely
                      populated areas, and conversely, in low density or rural
                      areas, TAZ boundaries can be larger than Place boundaries.
                      There are 101 Incorporated Places, 60 CDPs and 1454 TAZs
                      within the nine-county bay region.<br />
